      Hey, my name is Adam, and I graduated from CSU Chico in 2020. Currently,
      I&apos;m learning to be a junior full-stack web developer. I had to take
      about 2 and a half years off to be a full-time caregiver. I&apos;m
      passionate about taking ideas and turning them into stunning websites that
      are both easy to use and visually appealing. To me, web design is all
      about creating an experience that engages and delights users. I&apos;m
      constantly seeking new ways to make websites more user-friendly and
      functional, while also ensuring that they look great.

      While I&apos;m still new to open-source development, I&apos;m passionate
      about contributing to the community on platforms like GitHub. As I
      continue honing my skills, I aim to actively participate in open-source
      projects to help others and expand my own knowledge. I find great
      fulfillment in helping others and being involved in the community. My
      expertise lies in React, python, Next.js, and I&apos;ve had the pleasure
      of creating a couple dynamic and engaging websites that meet the specific
      needs of each project. Seeing the end result of my hard work is incredibly
      rewarding, and I&apos;m always striving to improve my skills and
      knowledge.
