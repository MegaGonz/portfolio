          creating functional yet visually appealing websites. While I&apos;m
          still working to master the complexities of web development, I aim to
          eventually push boundaries and make sites that are truly{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">exceptional</span>. For now, I&apos;m
          focused on honing my skills in order to build websites that balance
          usability and aesthetics.

          music, practicing sports, watching movies, and, of course, coding.
